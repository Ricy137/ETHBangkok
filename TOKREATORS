Introduction
itÂ´s a dapp that consist in onchain between coinbase and sign protocol using referal  base rewards system and payments. 

Problems to solve: 

Current onchain payments methods are excellent; however only payments are not enough to built a trust the financial system. Then we introduce  sign protocol  trying  to achieve a simple version of the trust financial system with payment methods of Coinbase.

Besides, by bring referral reward systems on chain would make the money flow of the system more transparent. 

Objetives & Estrategy:
Traceability: Sign protocol creates onchain agreements; so in the future if the on chain payments occurred conflicts, it can be presented as a proof to settle disrupt. 
Referal System:
For each microtransactions, the money would go to merchants and referrer automatically on chain with the payments methods provided by coinbase. 
Influencer Ownership:
Receive payments automatically without intermediaries.

Benefits:
Rewards (Tokens & Crypto) and property rights.

Describe the solution you'd like
The developer experience of <Checkout /> and <Swap /> components are good and they both provide compatibility for more advanced operations. However, the two components only work on the mainnet and it would provide a better DX if there's an method to test these two components without costing real money.

Describe alternatives you've considered.
Adding testnet support for Checkout /> and <Swap /> components.
