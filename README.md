## TOKREATORS

itÂ´s a dapp that consist in onchain between coinbase and sign protocol using referal  base rewards system and payments. 

## Problems to solve: 

Current onchain payments methods are excellent; however only payments are not enough to built a trust the financial system. Then we introduce  sign protocol  trying  to achieve a simple version of the trust financial system with payment methods of Coinbase.

Besides, by bring referral reward systems on chain would make the money flow of the system more transparent. 

## Objetives & Estrategy:

Traceability: Sign protocol creates onchain agreements; so in the future if the on chain payments occurred conflicts, it can be presented as a proof to settle disrupt. 

Referal System:
For each microtransactions, the money would go to merchants and referrer automatically on chain with the payments methods provided by coinbase. 

Influencer Ownership:
Receive payments automatically without intermediaries.


##Benefits:

Rewards (Tokens & Crypto) and property rights.
